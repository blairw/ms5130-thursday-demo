CVE-2024-27440,"The Toyoko Inn official App for iOS versions prior to 1.13.0 and Toyoko Inn official App for Android versions prior 1.3.14 don't properly verify server certificates, which allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate."
CVE-2024-27350,"Amazon Fire OS 7 before 7.6.6.9 and 8 before 8.1.0.3 allows Fire TV applications to establish local ADB (Android Debug Bridge) connections. NOTE: some third parties dispute whether this has security relevance, because an ADB connection is only possible after the (non-default) ADB Debugging option is enabled, and after the initiator of that specific connection attempt has been approved via a full-screen prompt."
